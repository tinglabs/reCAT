Description: reCAT is a modelling framework for unsynchronized single-cell transcriptome data that can reconstruct a high-resolution cell cycle time-series. It is mainly based on traveling salesman problem (TSP), Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and hidden Markov model (HMM). We developed an R based software package which is easy to use. The performance is relatively accurate and stable. Thanks for using!
